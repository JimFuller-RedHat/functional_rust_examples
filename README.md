# Functional Examples in Rust

Roughly based on a [presentation](https://github.com/xquery/xquery_functional_catalog/blob/master/balisage-2016.pptx) of functional programming I gave circa 2016 https://github.com/xquery/xquery_functional_catalog, in an alternate universe
where we all used functional programming languages on XML.

> make ex1

Anon functions / closures

Filter

Recursive
> make ex7

Walking the tree
> make ex8

Memoize

Y-Combination (stolen from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Y_combinator#Rust )
> make ex11

Algebraic data types with enums
